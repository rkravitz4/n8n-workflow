# 🎨 Restaurant Admin Website - Improvements Made

## 📋 **Overview**

I've reviewed and improved the restaurant admin website based on my **exact knowledge** of how the mobile app works, compared to the admin's guesses. Here are the key improvements made:

---

## ✅ **1. Reward Catalog Management - MAJOR UPGRADE**

### **What Was Wrong:**
- ❌ RewardImageUpload component existed but **wasn't being used**
- ❌ No image upload UI in the form
- ❌ No preview of how rewards look in mobile app

- ❌ Confusing value_cents input (no explanation)
- ❌ No validation or helper text

### **What I Fixed:**
- ✅ **Integrated RewardImageUpload component** into the form
- ✅ **Added mobile app preview** - Shows exactly how reward will appear
- ✅ **Created reward templates** - Quick creation of common rewards
- ✅ **Better UX for value_cents** - Shows preview of display value
- ✅ **Improved stats cards** - Total, active, with images, avg cost
- ✅ **Better empty state** - Helpful message and quick action
- ✅ **Enhanced table display** - Larger images, better formatting
- ✅ **Helper text everywhere** - Explains what each field does
- ✅ **Smart toggle for active/inactive** - Visual switch instead of checkbox

### **New Features:**

#### **Reward Templates** 🎯
Quick-create common rewards:
- $5 Off (500 points)
- $10 Off (1000 points)
- $15 Off (1500 points)

## ✅ **2. Toast Sync Monitoring - CORRECTED INFO**

### **What Was Wrong:**
- ❌ **Incorrect business hours** - Said "Weekdays 11am-10:15pm, Weekends 9:30am-10:15pm"
  - **ACTUAL:** Every day 11am-11pm (*/5 11-23 * * *)
- ❌ **Wrong Edge Function** - Called `loyalty-sync-orders` (old/doesn't exist)
  - **ACTUAL:** `scheduled-toast-sync` (v3 with simplified workflow)
- ❌ **Outdated phone verification info** - No longer relevant
- ❌ **Wrong code assignment info** - Said "first order assigns code"
  - **ACTUAL:** Users get code when they enroll in loyalty program
- ❌ **Missing reward tracking info** - No mention of smart reward marking

### **What I Fixed:**
- ✅ **Corrected cron schedule** - Now shows "Every 5 minutes, 11am-11pm"
- ✅ **Updated Edge Function call** - Now calls `scheduled-toast-sync` (correct v3 function)
- ✅ **Accurate "How It Works" section** - 6 steps with exact process:
  1. Auto-sync every 5 min (11am-11pm)
  2. Fetch orders from Toast (yesterday + today)
  3. Check for duplicates (skip if exists)
  4. Extract loyalty code from "$0 Loyalty Program" discount memo
  5. Award points (1 pt/$1, Cellar = 1.5x multiplier)
  6. **NEW:** Auto-detect and mark rewards as spent by discount amount

- ✅ **Added configuration display** - Shows Restaurant GUID, Store ID, Cron schedule
- ✅ **Two sync options:**
  - Scheduled Sync (recommended) - Syncs yesterday + today
  - Manual Sync - Specific business date
- ✅ **Better history display** - Shows business date, duration, accurate metrics
- ✅ **Removed outdated fields** - No more phone verification mentions
- ✅ **Added v3 callout** - Explains new simplified workflow

---

## ✅ **3. API Route Updates**

### **Updated:**
- `api/loyalty/sync/manual/route.ts` - Now calls correct Edge Function

### **What Changed:**
- ✅ Function URL: `loyalty-sync-orders` → `scheduled-toast-sync`
- ✅ Response format: Updated to match Toast integration v3
- ✅ Removed old loyalty_sync_history inserts (handled by Edge Function)
- ✅ Simplified response handling

---

## 🎯 **Key Differences: Admin Guesses vs Reality**

| Feature | Admin Guessed | Reality (What I Know) |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Business Hours** | Weekdays 11-10:15pm, Weekends 9:30-10:15pm | **Every day 11am-11pm** |
| **Sync Function** | loyalty-sync-orders | **scheduled-toast-sync (v3)** |
| **Code Assignment** | First order assigns code | **User enrollment assigns code** |
| **Reward Tracking** | Not mentioned | **Smart discount matching (v3)** |
| **Phone Verification** | Mentioned as key feature | **Old feature, not relevant** |
| **Point Multiplier** | Not mentioned | **Cellar tier = 1.5x points!** |
| **Reward Tokens** | Assumed needed | **Not needed - simplified in v3!** |

## 📱 **How Rewards Work (For Admin Reference)**

### **Customer Flow:**
1. Customer enrolls → Gets 4-digit loyalty code + $15 Welcome Reward
2. Customer earns points → $1 = 1 point (Cellar tier = 1.5x)
3. System tracks favorite dishes automatically (entrees, sandwiches, salads)
4. Customer redeems reward → Gets 4-hour token
5. Customer shows code to server
6. **Server enters JUST the loyalty code** (no reward tokens!)
7. Server applies discount in Toast
8. **System auto-detects and marks reward as spent** ✨

### **Admin Creates Rewards:**
1. Click "Add New Reward" or "Use Template"
2. Fill in details:
   - Name (e.g., "$10 Off")
   - Description
   - Points cost
   - Reward type
   - Value (in cents for $, or number for %)
3. **Upload image** (optional but recommended)
4. **Preview in mobile app mockup**
5. Save → Appears in mobile app immediately!
